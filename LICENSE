SPARTAN-117 and Sgt. Mjr. Johnson step from the tram into a crowd of cheering Marines, robot cameras hover around.

SPARTAN-117: "You told me there wouldn't be any cameras."
Sergeant Major Johnson: "And you told me you were gonna wear something nice! Folks need heroes, Chief. To give 'em hope. (raises cap, adjusts his hair, puts cap back on) So smile, would ya? While we still got something to smile about!"
Johnson and SPARTAN-117 walk to the end of the room, as the Bridge's blast doors open up.

The view changes to High Charity, where Tartarus and two of his Jiralhanae walk the Sangheili Commander, Thel 'Vadamee, out onto a ledge on High Charity. Honor Guard Elites are stationed on either side. Covenant Unggoy, Kig-Yar and Mgalekgolo have gathered on the walkway.

Unggoy: "He-re-tic! He-re-tic!"
They reach the ledge, in which we see the stadium seats filled with roaring Covenant aliens, and the Jiralhanae fix the Commander's arms onto floating cuffs.

Tartarus:(gleefully) "You've drawn quite a crowd."
Thel 'Vadamee: (bitterly) "If they've come to hear me beg, they will be disappointed."
Tartarus: "Are you sure?"
The entire crowd cheers as energy beams hit 'Vadamee on either side, and he shakes with pain.

The view changes back to the Cairo's bridge, dozens of Naval officers cheer as SPARTAN-117 and Sergeant Johnson approach Lord Hood at the end.

SPARTAN-117 and Johnson salute to Lord Hood.

Lord Hood: "Gentlemen, we're lucky to have you back."
An officer whispers to Lord Hood's ear.

Lord Hood: "Go ahead, Cortana."
Cortana's avatar appears on a nearby holotank.

Cortana: "Another whisper, sir, near Io. We have probes en route."
Lord Hood: "I apologize, but we're going to have to make this quick."
Lord Hood turns away.

Cortana looks up at SPARTAN-117 and Johnson.

Cortana: "You look nice."
SPARTAN-117: (simultaneously with Johnson) "Thanks."
Sergeant Johnson: "Thank you."
SPARTAN-117 and Johnson look at each other.

Lord Hood picks up a Colonial Cross medal from a red-clothed case containing two other Colonial Cross medals.

Lord Hood: "Sergeant Major, The Colonial Cross is awarded for acts of singular daring and devotion, for a soldier of the United Earth Space Corps..."
Hood places the medal on Johnson's uniform.

The view changes back to High Charity, on Tartarus' face.

Tartarus: "...There can be no greater heresy! Let him be an example for all who would break our Covenant!"
The Covenant crowd cheers once more. Tartarus barks an order, and two Brutes grab onto 'Vadamee's now charred armor and pull.

The view once again changes back to Cairo Station, as a young woman joins SPARTAN-117 and Johnson.

Lord Hood: "Commander Miranda Keyes. Your father's actions were in keeping with the highest traditions of military service. His bravery in the face of impossible odds reflects great credit, upon himself, and the UNSC. The Navy has lost one of its best."
Hood hands her the Colonial Cross medal.

The view changes back to High Charity again, where a blackened Sangheili Combat helmet falls to the floor, and the naked 'Vadamee hangs limply from his restraints. A glowing brand rises from the floor behind him, and Tartarus grabs it and strides forward.

Thel 'Vadamee raises his head weakly. Tartarus gives him a fierce look, and presses the brand against the Elite's chest with malice. The tortured Thel 'Vadamee fights the pain but gives in and screams.

The view once more changes to Cairo Station, where alarms start to sound.

Cortana: "Slipspace ruptures directly off our battle cluster."
Lord Hood: "Show me."
Images of Covenant ships appears on a large screen.

Cortana: "Fifteen Covenant capital ships holding position just outside the kill zone."
The screen shows UNSC ships approaching the Covenant fleet.

Fleet Admiral Harper (COM): "This is Fleet Admiral Harper. We are engaging the enemy."
Lord Hood: "Negative, Admiral. Form a defensive perimeter around the cluster." (to Miranda Keyes) "Commander, get to your ship, link up with the fleet."
Keyes salutes.

Commander Keyes: "Yes, sir." (leaves)
Lord Hood: "You have the MAC gun, Cortana. As soon as they come in range, open up."
Cortana: "Gladly."
Cortana's avatar disappears.

Lord Hood: "Something's not right... The fleet that destroyed Reach was fifty times this size."
An Officer faces Lord Hood.

Officer: (panicked) "Sir, additional contacts. Boarding crafts and lots of 'em!"
The view shifts back to the screen.

Lord Hood: "They're going to try to take our MAC guns offline, give their capital ships a straight shot at Earth. (Looks to SPARTAN-117) Master Chief, defend this station!"
SPARTAN-117: "Yes, sir." (to Johnson) "I need a weapon."
Sergeant Johnson: "Right this way."
Johnson and SPARTAN-117 leave the bridge, as Lord Hood turns back to his command station. Through the bay windows looking up to the MAC cannon, the fleet turns to engage the Covenant attackers. Longsword fighters hurtle overhead trailed by Marathon-class Cruisers.

{Gameplay}

Cairo Defense Coordinator (Loudspeaker): "Alert! Boarders inbound"
Cairo Defense Coordinator (Loudspeaker): "All hands report to battle stations. This is not a drill. I repeat, this is not a drill!"
Sergeant Johnson (COM): "How's it going, Malta?"
Malta Defense Coordinator (COM): "Stand-by... they're latched! Check your targets and watch the crossfires."
Malta Defense Coordinator (COM): "They're in standard formation: little bastards up front, big ones in back... Good luck, Cairo."
Outside, a Covenant Boarding Craft latches onto the hull, causing the station to shake. Weapons fire is soon heard from outside the doorway.

Sergeant Johnson: "I need a Field of fire on that bulkhead. As soon as that door opens, let 'em have it!"
The Marines take up position around a sealed bulkhead. Johnson sets up a stationary gun turret. A bright light and crackling noise, like a welding torch, comes from the center of the door, and is soon followed by an explosion, where the door explodes and Covenant intruders appear.
